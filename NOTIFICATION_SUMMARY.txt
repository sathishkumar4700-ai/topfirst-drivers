NOTIFICATION SYSTEM - WHO GETS WHAT

CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION (index.html - Client-Side Only)
======================================================

WHO SEES NOTIFICATIONS:
- Only the person viewing the page in their browser
- Notifications are LOCAL to each user's browser
- No cross-user notifications yet

EXAMPLES:
---------

1. DRIVER REGISTERS:
   ✅ Driver sees: "Registration Submitted"
   ❌ Admin does NOT see anything
   
2. ADMIN APPROVES DRIVER:
   ✅ Admin sees: "Driver Approved"
   ❌ Driver does NOT see anything
   
3. CUSTOMER BOOKS RIDE:
   ✅ Customer sees: "Booking Created"
   ❌ Admin does NOT see anything
   ❌ Driver does NOT see anything

WHAT'S WORKING:
---------------
✅ Browser notifications (for own actions)
✅ Toast messages
✅ Notification center
✅ Sound alerts
✅ Persistent storage (localStorage)

WHAT'S NOT WORKING:
-------------------
❌ Cross-user notifications
❌ Real-time updates
❌ Email notifications
❌ SMS notifications
❌ WhatsApp notifications

TO GET FULL NOTIFICATIONS:
--------------------------
Need to:
1. Connect to backend API (already created!)
2. Add email service (SendGrid/Twilio)
3. Add WebSocket for real-time
4. Add SMS service (Twilio)

QUICK ANSWER:
-------------
Right now, notifications only show to the person taking the action.
Other users don't see anything automatically.

For full cross-user notifications, need backend integration.
